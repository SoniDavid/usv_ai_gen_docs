# Tutorial: src

This project is a *simulation framework* for maritime robotics competitions, specifically for the Virtual RobotX (VRX) challenge. It provides a realistic virtual environment where a robotic boat operates under the influence of environmental factors like **simulated waves** and **wind**. The core of the project is a flexible **scoring system** that manages different tasks, such as navigation and docking, by tracking the vehicle's progress and applying rules. The vehicle's movement is governed by a detailed **hydrodynamics engine** that simulates buoyancy and drag, creating a lifelike experience for testing robot autonomy.
