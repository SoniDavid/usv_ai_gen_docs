# Tutorial: LIO-SAM

LIO-SAM is a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system that creates a **detailed 3D map** of an environment while simultaneously tracking the sensor's position within it.
It achieves high accuracy by *tightly-coupling* information from a spinning **LiDAR** sensor with a high-frequency **IMU** (Inertial Measurement Unit). The entire system is built as a pipeline of specialized nodes and uses a powerful optimization technique called a *factor graph* to continuously refine the map and trajectory, correcting for drift over time.
