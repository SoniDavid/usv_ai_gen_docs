# Tutorial: robot_localization

`robot_localization` is a powerful ROS package for robot state estimation. It uses advanced algorithms, like the **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** and **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)**, to determine a robot's precise position, orientation, and velocity. The system *fuses* noisy data from various sensors—such as wheel encoders, IMUs, and GPS—into a single, more accurate and complete state estimate. Users have fine-grained control over this fusion process through simple configuration files. The package also includes a specialized `navsat_transform_node` to properly integrate *global GPS data* with the robot's local coordinate system.
