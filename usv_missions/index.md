# Tutorial: src

This project powers an autonomous boat, or *Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)*. The central **Mission Handler** acts as the boat's brain, deciding which task to perform from a schedule. Each task, like navigating a channel or docking, is defined by a **Mission** playbook.

To understand its surroundings, the boat builds a **Global Obstacle Register**, which is a persistent *world map* of buoys and other objects. This map is built from sensor data, which can be faked by the **Obstacle Publisher** for easy testing. When a mission runs, it generates a path using **Waypoint Navigation**, and all components communicate about objects using a shared **Obstacle Data Model**.
