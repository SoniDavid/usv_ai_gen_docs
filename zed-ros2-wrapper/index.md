# Tutorial: zed-ros2-wrapper

This project is a **ROS 2 driver** for Stereolabs ZED cameras, acting as a *bridge* to connect the camera's powerful 3D vision capabilities with the robotics software ecosystem. It allows a robot to stream essential data like *images*, *depth maps*, and *3D point clouds*. More importantly, it unlocks the camera's built-in AI, providing advanced features like **object detection**, **body tracking**, and **real-time positional tracking** directly within ROS 2. Users can easily enable and customize these features through configuration files, making it a versatile tool for navigation, perception, and interaction tasks.
