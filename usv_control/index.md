# Tutorial: src

This project is a complete *control system* for a robotic boat, also known as an **Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)**. It allows the boat to autonomously navigate a series of *waypoints* to complete a mission, much like a car following a GPS route. The system includes a **simulator** to test the software without a physical boat, path planners to create smooth routes, a guidance system to stay on track, and low-level controllers that translate steering commands into actual thruster movements. It also features a safety system for *obstacle avoidance*.
