# Tutorial: perception_pcl

The `perception_pcl` project acts as a crucial bridge, allowing the powerful *Point Cloud Library (PCL)* to be used seamlessly within the **Robot Operating System (ROS)**. It provides a collection of ready-to-use ROS components for building complex 3D perception pipelines. With this project, developers can easily **filter**, **segment**, and extract **features** from point cloud data, as well as manage and transform it for various robotics tasks.
