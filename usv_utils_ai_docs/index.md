# Tutorial: usv_utils

This project provides the essential software for an *autonomous robotic boat (USV)*. It acts as the boat's central nervous system, taking in raw data from sensors like GPS and making sense of it. The software helps the boat understand **where it is** and how it's moving, keeps track of **nearby obstacles** to avoid collisions, and constantly runs a **health check** on all its critical components. It includes tools to launch all these processes, as well as a *safety switch* for testing in simulation.
