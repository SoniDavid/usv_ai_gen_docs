# Tutorial: ros_gz

`ros_gz` is the official project for connecting the **ROS 2** ecosystem with the **Gazebo** simulator (formerly *Ignition*).
It acts as a communication bridge, allowing you to send commands to simulated robots and receive sensor data back into your ROS application.
The core of this is a versatile **Parameter Bridge** that translates messages between the two systems. The project also provides *convenience tools* for easily launching simulations and *specialized plugins* for integrating complex sensors.
